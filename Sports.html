		For a young agr i have always had a love of water and through out primary school had went to swimming lessons 
		after school in my local swimming pool as welll as going in to the swimming pool with my two brother and my father.
		My mother believe it is very important fir children to know how to swim from a young age incase they ever get into difficulty 
		when swimming, as she herslef has a fear of water. Every year the Brank of Irealng host a primary schools gala so in fourth
		me and my friends had decided that we would take part having no background in competive swimming amd we were all pretty positive 
		we would complete the length.I came first in my race and to top it all of i came first in my entire heat. <br>
		So my mother decided to join me into the local swimming club in which i spent 8 years as a member before moving making it impossible to 
		for to any longer part take in training. During my 8 years i soent the 1st year just doing a friday evening a week however by the second
		year i was training three evenings after school as well as a saturday morning. By the third Year i was training 5 times a week
		5 mornings before school as well as two days during the weekend <br>
